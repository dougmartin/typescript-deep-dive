# typescript-deep-dive
TypeScript server and client for a simple git repo viewer.

NOTE: This was built for the __TypeScript Deep Dive__ talk at [NERD Summit 2017](https://nerdsummit.org/).  It is composed of just two files 
to make the presentation easier to run - I don't recommend using this file layout for production applications.
